# Sales Analysis & Prediction Project
Performing EDA on Sales, as well as data cleaning and preprocessing, then used Linear Regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditure for TV and Radio. Then evaluated the model using R2, MAE and MSE.

## Project Overview
This project uses **EDA** and **Linear Regression** to predict sales based on advertising expenditures (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The goal is to analyze advertising impact and build an accurate prediction model.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Advertising dataset (provided).  
- **Features**:  
   - `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV.  
   - `Radio`: Advertising budget spent on Radio.  
   - `Newspaper`: Advertising budget spent on Newspapers.  
- **Target**: `Sales` (total sales).

## Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter lab** for development

## Results
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.91 (91% variance explained)  
- **MAE**: 1.27  
- **MSE**: 2.85
